## 📌 Our workflow:
1. Setting up the project structure

5. Setting up the server
6. Creating a JSON object from our object 
7. Extracting the array of plant names from the JSON object
8. Getting the user input value with an event listener
9. Writing a function that matches input values with a dummy array
10. Deploying what we managed to write so far on Heroku
