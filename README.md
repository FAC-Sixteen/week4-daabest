## 📌 Our workflow:
1. Setting up the project structure 
2. Creating our object
3. Drawing our user journey
4. Initial HTML and CSS setup
5. Setting up the server
6. Creating a JSON object from our object 
7. Extracting the array of plant names from the JSON object
8. Getting the user input value with an event listener
9. Writing a function that matches input values with a dummy array
10. Deploying what we managed to write so far on Heroku

## 🚀 Deployment

## 🔥 Problems & what we've learned
- not understanding what url endpoints are and where they come from 🙃🙃🙃
- API struggles - trying and failing to find a usable and obtainable one --> ended up creating one manually (Wikipedia: sandbox documentation not great; GitHub: we struggled much, private data shall remain private)
- filepath syntax can be tricky (.., concatenation, comma vs slash, etc)
- where do requests come from and how are they handled?
- we did not listen to anybody despite nodding understandingly

- we struggled to access the .json object
- understanding front- and back-end communication
- wolfsbane (aconitum genus) vs wolf's bane (arnica montana)?? (Anna T's personal problem)
